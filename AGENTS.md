# F Commerce Order Manager

## Stack

- **Language and runtime**: TypeScript, Node.js
- **Framework**: Next.js app router, Express
- **Key dependencies**: MongoDB with Mongoose, JWT authentication, BullMQ with Redis, Cloudinary
- **Package manager**: npm 10 with npm workspaces

## Build approach

Tracer Bullet, build each feature as a thin complete path through the database, API, and UI.

## Commands

```bash
# Install
npm ci

# Dev servers
npm run dev

# Build
npm run build

# Test
npm run test

# Quality checks
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run format:check
```

## Specs

Stored in `docs/specs/`. Format: `docs/specs/NNNN-title.md`.

## Rules

- Keep the four Clean Architecture layers separate: `domain`, `application`, `infrastructure`, and `presentation`.
- Keep domain logic independent from frameworks, databases, HTTP clients, and other I/O.
- Make outer layers depend on inner layers, never the reverse.
- Keep use cases as thin orchestrators and enforce business invariants in entities.
- Use DTOs or plain objects across layer boundaries. Do not expose domain entities to presentation code.
- Use strict TypeScript. Avoid `any` and require exhaustive types.
- Organize application code by layer, with clear and consistent naming.
- Document public APIs and use one consistent error handling pattern.
- Validate environment variables at startup and use named exports only.
- Keep the UI accessible to the WCAG AA baseline.
- Use conventional commit messages.

## Tooling

- Use the standard ESLint and Prettier setup for Next.js and Express.
- Run lint, format, and typecheck before each commit.
- Use unit and integration tests.
- Run basic continuous integration checks on push for lint, typecheck, and tests.

## Git

- integration: on
- branch prefix: `feat/`
- commit: per milestone
