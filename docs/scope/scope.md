# Scope: F-Commerce Order Manager

A mobile-first SaaS for small businesses selling products through Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and similar channels. Sellers create, confirm, ship and track orders while managing inventory, customers and profit.

**Build approach:** Tracer Bullet (vertical slices every feature built end to end through DB, API and UI).

**Workflow:** GA (verify, test, model review, document after develop).

_These are recommendations to keep your build orderly, not requirements. Skip anything that does not fit: if you already know how to build a feature, use `/develop` and skip `/architect`. You decide when a feature is `done`._

## Foundations

### 1. Stack & architecture · done

Decide the full stack (frontend, backend, database) and scaffold a runnable project.
**Done when:** the chosen stack is captured in the spec, the repo boots locally, and the workspace smoke tests pass.

- [x] Design it (spec): `/architect stack & architecture`
      Spec [0001](../specs/0001-stack-and-architecture.md)
- [x] Build it: `/develop scaffold`
  - [x] Workspace monorepo and shared contracts scaffolded (AC scaffold acceptance)
  - [x] Frontend and backend runnable with health smoke test (AC frontend and backend startup)
  - [x] Local services, environment examples, lint, tests, builds, and CI added (AC local services and tooling)
- [x] Verify it: `/check verify scaffold`
- [x] Test it: `/test scaffold`
- [x] Review it (fresh model): `/check review scaffold`
- [x] Document it: `/document scaffold`
      Spec 0001 · code in `frontend/`, `backend/`, and `packages/contracts/`

### 2. Data model · done

Core entities: users, businesses, customers, products, categories, orders, order items, payments, expenses, inventory transactions.
**Done when:** schema supports full order lifecycle with tenant isolation and historical snapshots.

- [x] Design it (spec): `/architect data model`

- [x] Setup tooling: `/develop tooling`
- [x] Finish workspace checks and review follow-ups: `/check verify tooling`
      Root `AGENTS.md`, workspace scripts, and repo-level tooling are in place; startup validation and CI follow-up still need final pass.

## /scope replan · F-Commerce Order Manager

**3 foundation features are in the current pass (1 done, 2 in progress, 0 deferred), build approach Tracer Bullet, workflow GA.**
Next: `/develop data model`, then `/check verify tooling`, then `/architect design system & UI foundation`
Heads up: the backend scaffold smoke test currently times out while waiting for the startup message. Frontend and contracts tests pass. The remaining product work includes the UI system, auth, onboarding, and the data model build path. Scope written to `docs/scope/scope.md`.

## Legend

**The decision box.** Every feature carries exactly one, the sub-task whose label ends with `(spec)`. Its wording varies (`Design it (spec)` normally, `Decide the stack (spec)` on Stack & architecture), so skills locate it by that `(spec)` suffix, never by an exact label. Every other box is an execution box and `/architect` never ticks one.

**Feature lifecycle:** the scope updates as a feature moves; each row is what it shows and who sets it:

| State                    | Set by                           | The feature shows                                                            |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `planned`                | `/scope`                         | one box: `Design it (spec): /architect <feature>`                            |
| `in-progress` (designed) | **`/architect` at spec capture** | `Design it` ticked; spec linked; `Build it: /develop <feature>` + milestones |
| `in-progress` (building) | `/develop`                       | milestone sub-boxes tick one by one                                          |
| `in-progress` (verified) | `/check verify`                  | `Build it` + milestones ticked; `Verify it` ticked                           |
| `done`                   | **you, when you decide it is**   | boxes you ran ticked; tier's last stage completed                            |

- **Approach tag** beside heading overrides project default for that feature.
- **Workflow tier tag** sets one feature's rigor (GA = verify, test, review, document).
- **Pointer line** (`spec <n> · code in <path>`) appears only after those exist.

## Deferred

Out of scope for the current build pass, kept so the plan stays honest.

- **Subscription billing**: integrate Stripe/checkout once MVP proves fit
- **Courier API integrations**: live tracking once core workflow is stable
- **Social channel APIs**: Facebook/WhatsApp order import via future integrations
- **Advanced analytics**: AI insights after basic reporting works
