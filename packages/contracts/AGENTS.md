# Contracts

## Overview

The contracts package contains shared TypeScript DTOs, Zod schemas, enums, and API error types. It is the boundary shared by the frontend and backend and must not import application, domain, infrastructure, or presentation code.

## Key files

## Commands

Run from the repository root with npm workspaces:

```bash
npm run build --workspace @f-commerce/contracts
npm run lint --workspace @f-commerce/contracts
npm run typecheck --workspace @f-commerce/contracts
npm run test --workspace @f-commerce/contracts
```

## Conventions

- Keep runtime validation in Zod schemas and derive TypeScript types from those schemas where practical.
- Export only DTOs, schemas, enums, and API error types.
- Keep this package independent from backend internals and frontend components.
- Use native ESM, strict TypeScript, and named exports.

_Drafted by /audit from the repo, worth a quick human pass. Edit freely: once a line stops matching this draft, later runs treat it as curated and will flag rather than overwrite._
