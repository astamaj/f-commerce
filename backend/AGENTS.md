# Backend

## Overview

The backend is the Express API workspace. It currently exposes the health endpoint and will host the application, domain, infrastructure, and presentation layers as features are added.

## Key files

| File                 | Owns                                         |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `src/server.ts`      | Express app setup, `/health`, `/api/auth`    |
| `src/server.test.ts` | Health smoke test without MongoDB or Redis   |
| `src/infrastructure/database/mongoose/models/BaseSchema.ts` | Global Mongoose plugin for strict tenant isolation |
| `src/application/services/auth.service.ts` | Core authentication and tenant logic (Clean Arch) |
| `package.json`       | Backend scripts and dependencies             |

## Commands

Run from the repository root with npm workspaces:

```bash
npm run dev --workspace @f-commerce/backend
npm run build --workspace @f-commerce/backend
npm run lint --workspace @f-commerce/backend
npm run typecheck --workspace @f-commerce/backend
npm run test --workspace @f-commerce/backend
```

## Conventions

- The workspace uses native ESM and strict TypeScript.
- Keep the health smoke test independent from external services.
- Keep backend dependencies behind the four Clean Architecture layers defined by the root context.
- Use named exports and avoid `any`.

## Gotchas

- The backend development server uses port 4000 by default.
- The server validates the required backend environment variables from docs/specs/0001-stack-and-architecture.md using Zod.
- Tenant isolation is strictly enforced by a global Mongoose plugin using `AsyncLocalStorage`. If background workers or admin scripts need to operate across tenants, they must explicitly set `{ bypassTenantIsolation: true }` in query options or use `runWithContext`.

_Drafted by /audit from the repo, worth a quick human pass. Edit freely: once a line stops matching this draft, later runs treat it as curated and will flag rather than overwrite._
