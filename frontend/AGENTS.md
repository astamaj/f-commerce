# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## Overview

The Next.js UI runs on port 3000 and uses server components by default. It imports only from `@f-commerce/contracts`.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # start dev server (frontend on 3000, backend on 4000)
npm run build      # next build
npm run lint       # ESLint over the whole workspace
npm run test       # Vitest unit plus Playwright e2e
```

## Conventions
- Keep components pure; avoid imperative DOM calls.
- Use named exports only; no `any` types.
- Prefer server components for data fetching; stream data to the client.

## Gotchas
- The dev server defaults to port 3000 for Next and port 4000 for the Express backend.
- Do not edit `package-lock.json` directly; run `npm ci` to sync the monorepo lockfile.
- Run the e2e suite from the frontend workspace after installing Playwright browsers.
